      <h2>Force ipsum</h2>
      <p>Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things.
      It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.
      And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it.</p>

      <p>Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys!
      Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position.
      I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low.
      This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.</p>

      <h2>Force ipsum 3</h2>
      <p>Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time.
      I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo!
      Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.
      What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.</p>

      <h2>Force ipsum 4</h2>
      <p>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss.
      Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
      We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!
      Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower?
      You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!
      See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!</p>
